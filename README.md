## Build Instructions
Pre-requisites: 
- You need to have "Postman" installed
- User need to have two S3 buckets:
  e.g. for webapp: yourdomain.tld 
       for code deploy: code-deploy.yourdomain.tld  
  where yourdomain.tld should be replaced with your domain name

1. Clone the git repository.
2. Traverse to the folder /csye6225-spring2019/webapp

```bash
curl -u c18fdd17d3cbb353f7231e5e8f76cbc5d2bebdc1 -d build_parameters[CIRCLE_JOB]=build https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/sreeragsreenath/csye6225-spring2019/tree/assignment5
```


## Instruction To run application
1. Make Unauthenticated HTTP Request Execute following command on your bash shell
